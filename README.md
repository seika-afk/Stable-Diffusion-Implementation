# ðŸ§  Stable Diffusion Implementation (from Scratch)

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of **Stable Diffusion**, a state-of-the-art deep generative model for image synthesis.

## ðŸ“˜ What is Stable Diffusion?

Stable Diffusion is a **latent diffusion model (LDM)** that generates high-quality images from text prompts. It learns to denoise random noise into meaningful images through a process called **denoising diffusion**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Stable_diffusion_Implementation.ipynb`:  
  The main Jupyter notebook implementing each step from loading the model to generating images from prompts.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate scipy safetensors
```

Also, ensure you're using a GPU-enabled runtime (like Colab with GPU).

## ðŸš€ Running the Notebook

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter/Colab.
3. Make sure you're using a GPU runtime.
4. Run all cells â€” the notebook will:
   - Load the pretrained Stable Diffusion model
   - Disable the safety checker for full control
   - Generate stunning images from your text prompts âœ¨


## ðŸ§ª Example Prompt

```python
prompt = "a futuristic cityscape at sunset, highly detailed"
```

Yields an image like:
